Movie App
Improvements I would do, that I didn't have time to do properly:
  - Pagination
  - Ui states handling, with Loading, Empty and Error states used everywhere
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Genre Pill in Moive Details Screen as a custom view group and directly initilize with the genres list
  - More custom Styling / theming
